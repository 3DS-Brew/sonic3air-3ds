If needed, install them via "sudo apt-get install" (for Debian-based systems, this may differ for other Linux distributions).
	- g++
	- cmake
	- libgl1-mesa-dev
	- libglu1-mesa-dev
	- libasound2-dev
	- libpulse-dev
	=> Complete line to copy:   sudo apt-get install g++ cmake libgl1-mesa-dev libglu1-mesa-dev libasound2-dev libpulse-dev

Setup and build with CMake:
	- cd ./Oxygen/sonic3air/source/_cmake/build
	- cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
	- cmake --build .
