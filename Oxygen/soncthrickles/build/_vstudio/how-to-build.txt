
=== Build for Windows using Visual Studio ===


PLEASE NOTE:

- The Visual Studio projects are configured for statically linking all libraries together
	into one exe. This applies to the external dependencies as well. (Only exception is the
	Discord Game SDK.)

- There is no working 64-bit build due to a linker error I did not resolve (as the public
	releases for Windows are 32-bit anyways). This can probably be fixed with few changes
	to SDL2, or by switching back to dynamic linking - at least for SDL2.



>>> What you need

Visual Studio 2019 (either Community or Pro edition) with the "Desktop development with C++"
workload installed.

The Visual Studio 2022 Preview should could as well, but isn't tested yet.



>>> Build the external dependencies in "framework"

Under "framework/external", you can find multiple libraries that S3AIR is built upon.
Each of them needs to be built once following the "how-to-build.txt" in each library's directory.

If building from the S3AIR Github repository, you can ignore the "If downloaded xyz separately or
updating it" part of the instructions, as these changes are already applied to the Visual Studio
projects.

So you only need to build all required configurations, and then execute the copy scripts.



>>> Build the main Visual Studio solution

Open the "sonic3air.sln" right next to this text file. Choose "sonic3air" as startup project and
build / run it. That's all.
